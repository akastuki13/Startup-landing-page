	<h2>What is Distracted Driving?</h2>
	<p><b>Distracted driving</b> is a significant safety concern, as it involves any activity that diverts attention from driving. This includes texting, talking on the phone, eating, drinking, talking to passengers, and using in-car technologies such as GPS. The primary danger lies in the fact that even a momentary lapse in attention can lead to severe consequences. When drivers are distracted, they are less able to react to sudden changes in the road, such as stopping vehicles, <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWyLCoZXsD5R9uBaSyOBrTzlpuo8K0VrxSiw&s" target="_blank">pedestrians</a> crossing, or unexpected obstacles. This delay in reaction time can result in accidents, injuries, and even fatalities.</p>

	<h2>Types of Distracted Driving</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Visual Distractions:</b></li>
		<p>Visual driving distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road. Examples include activities such as checking your GPS or navigation system, looking to see what song is playing on the radio, and searching for mirror or temperature controls or lost items on the floor of your vehicle.</p>
		<li><b>Manual Distractions:</b></li>
		<p>Manual distractions are defined as distractions that cause you to take your hands off of the wheel, such as eating, drinking, smoking, checking your phone, adjusting the radio or setting a destination in your vehicle’s in-dash navigation system.</p>
		<li><b>Cognitive Distractions:</b></li>
		<p>Cognitive distractions take your focus and concentration away from driving. This could be anything from talking to other passengers in the vehicle to road rage or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Stress and fatigue are also a factor.</p>
		<p>Drowsy or fatigued driving is a form of cognitive distraction that is suspected to contribute to more than 100,000 crashes each year — including 40,000 injuries and some 1,550 deaths. Many experts feel that these crashes are under-reported, and the actual numbers may be much higher.</p>
		<p>Distracted drivers are also less likely to safely respond to adverse roadways and weather conditions by failing to recognize hazards and reacting too slowly to changing traffic conditions.</p>
		<p><b>Two of the most common distractions — talking on cell phones or texting while driving — are especially dangerous because they fall under all three types of distracted driving.</b> Many states have enacted laws making it illegal to use the phone behind the wheel — even for hands-free calls —  and texting while driving is illegal in most states. Federal law prohibits all commercial drivers from using hand-held mobile devices while driving.</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>Ways to Avoid Distractions</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/research/distracted-driving-statistics/" target="_blank">Driving requires your full attention</a>, and the best way to avoid distractions is to stay focused and keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.</p>
	<p>Of course, drivers should avoid eating and smoking while driving and should never drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but other best practices include pulling over to read directions or setting navigation systems before you start driving.</p>
	<p>Using radio pre-sets eliminates the need to tune to your favorite channels, and all adjustments to mirrors, seats and steering should be made prior to getting on the road.</p>
	<p>To avoid the temptation of taking phone calls and answering texts and e-mails from behind the wheel, drivers should set their phones to “Do Not Disturb” and turn off the ringer while driving. It is also a good habit to keep your phone out of reach while you are in the car.</p>

	<h2>Results of Distracted Driving</h2>
	<p>According to the CDC, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 are injured in distracted driving-related crashes every day in the U.S.</p>
	<p>Distracted driving is defined as “doing another activity while operating a motor vehicle.” Everyone knows that you should pay attention while driving, but not many practices absolute focus behind the wheel.</p>
	<p>Here are two unbelievable distracted driving crashes that resulted in tragedy and what you can learn from them.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><h2>17-year-old checks Facebook while driving, kills man and his 10-year-old daughter<h2></li>
			<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/girl-17-charged-in-sherburne-co-crash-that-killed-2/">A 17-year-old was checking Facebook and driving</a> in Minnesota and ended up running a red light. While careening through the intersection, her pickup truck smashed into another vehicle, killing a father and his young daughter. The driver was also injured. Gruesome images show her impaled by a pole.</p>
			<p>Texting and driving is never a good idea. Wait a few minutes until you have safely reached your destination and then respond. No amount of FOMO (fear of missing out) is worth your life or that of an innocent fellow driver’s.</p>
		<li><h2>Teen survives first distracted-driving crash, but not the second</h2></li>
		    <p><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article71022122.html">Amanda Clark</a> was on the phone when her Chevrolet Trailblazer rolled three times, landing on its roof. According to the Sacramento Bee, the Oakdale teen wrote about her near-death experience. “I hate the thought of dying without my family knowing how I felt about them,” she wrote.</p>
		    <p>One year later, she was driving while on the phone again, and lost control of her car, crashing violently. Cellphone records proved that she was texting. She was found unresponsive at the scene and died the next day.</p>
		    <p>The simple solution here is to not text and drive. Even speaking on the phone can be a form of distracted driving. If you must answer a call, use the hands-free function but do everything you can to refrain from phone use while driving.</p>
